🚀 Online Payment Fraud Detection – A Hybrid CNN + XGBoost Revolution

> 🌍 Millions of online transactions happen every second.
💳 Among them, a silent enemy hides — fraudulent payments.
🤔 The challenge? Spotting them fast, accurately, and with confidence.

And that’s where this project comes in.

🌟 The Big Idea

Instead of relying on just traditional machine learning or deep learning alone,
we combine the feature extraction power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with the classification strength of XGBoost.

The result?
A hybrid fraud detection system that is:

⚡ Fast

🎯 Accurate

🔒 Reliable


🎯 Objectives

Detect fraudulent online payments with high precision.

Reduce false positives to protect genuine users.

Prove the power of hybrid AI models in financial security.

📊 Workflow – How It All Works

1. Data Preprocessing 🧹

Handle class imbalance

Scale features

Clean anomalies



2. CNN Feature Extraction 🧠

Deep features learned automatically

Transform raw transaction data into meaningful representations



3. XGBoost Classification 🌳

Gradient boosting trees classify transactions as Fraudulent or Genuine



4. Hybrid Model Fusion 🔗

CNN extracts → XGBoost decides

The perfect balance of deep learning + boosting
